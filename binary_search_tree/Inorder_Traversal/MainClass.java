 1.	Convert a BST to a Binary Tree such that sum of all greater keys is added to every key
	Given a Binary Search Tree (BST), convert it to a Binary Tree such that every key of the original BST is changed 
	to key plus sum of all greater keys in BST.
	
	Examples:
	
	Input: Root of following BST
	              5
	            /   \
	           2     13
	
	Output: The given BST is converted to following Binary Tree
	              18
	            /   \
	          20     13
 2.	Objective: Given a binary search tree (BST), convert it into greater sum tree.

	What is greater sum tree: Greater sum tree is a tree in which every node contains the sum of all the nodes 
	which are greater than the node.  see the example below
	
	Input: Root of following BST
	              10
	            /    \
	          5       15
			 /  \    /  \
			2    7  12   20
	
	Output: The given BST is converted to following Binary Tree
	              47
	            /    \
	          64      20
			 /  \    /  \
